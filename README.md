# Website Blocker 
By Henry Zheng

Chrome extension

Productivity tool to block websites that distract you from your work. 

Does NOT read or send your data to a third-party server -- if you can understand it, look at the source code to verify, or get someone who can.

No frills, not fancy, simple and lightweight.


Enjoy~
